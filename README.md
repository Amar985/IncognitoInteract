# IncognitoInteract

IncognitoInteract is a Flask-based web application that utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for secure text encryption and decryption.

## How it Works

Users can input a plain text message and a password, which will be encrypted using AES. The resulting cipher text can then be shared with intended recipients. To decrypt the message, recipients input the cipher text along with the password provided by the sender.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using:

` pip install -r requirements.txt `
